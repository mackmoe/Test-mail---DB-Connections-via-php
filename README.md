Description: This script was written to test simple issues with a website's ability to connect to databases and it can also test mail functionality from the server(s) it lives on. Please feel free to use this script in any way you would like, you don't have to ask! You may also re-use this in any way you would like, however please give credit where credit is due.  

Special thanks to Gene and Kenny, if it weren't for them, this script would have never been made!  

## Usage
Just upload the script to any web facing directory (content should do) then in a browser, go to "domain.com/cs-connector/connector.php"

## Notes
Use a captcha for mail and also use mysqli::real_escape_string for queries before they are sent
